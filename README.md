# Menstrual Cycle Tracker

There are 13 moon cycles in a calendar year, and it is fascinating that women have 13 menstrual cycles in the same period. Even if science doesn't want to make the connection, it is quite obvious and has a rich history in ancient calendars. Interestingly enough, if we were to divide the calendar year into equal number of days having months, there also would be 13 of them.

For females, in general, it is always a bit of a hassle to monitor their cycles, write down dates, and keep track. Therefore, it is rather convenient to have a way to count it for you. Even more, as we discovered this nature's link with moon cycles, let's find out how they correlate. This program can track the exact moon phase during your cycle, assign the energy type depending on it, and track how similar the intervals are to the moon phases. By inputting data, users will get advice on how to embrace particular energy, and describe its potential. So embrace your femininity and get in sync with nature, ladies!
