You are on the Pink Moon Cycle.

Menstrual / bleeding phase | WANING MOON
Pre-ovulation / follicular phase | NEW MOON
Ovulation phase | WAXING MOON
Pre-menstrual / luteal phase | FULL MOON

This cycle is about growth, creativity, and expansion. It's a time to embrace new ideas and explore your creative side.

Often women who have had a white Moon cycle will transition to the pink cycle when they’re entering a new phase of their own self-realisation.

Women who are used to giving, providing, and nurturing others, and are moving away from this stage of life (even momentarily) may find themselves in a pink Moon cycle.
Women who have done a lot of inner work, and become proficient in navigating their inner world may find they are ready to emerge into the world in a new way, and this can coincide with her experiencing purple cycles.

Getting your period between the new and full moons can be indicative of a transitional phase in your life. You’re a Pink Moon woman if your period falls on or near the waxing crescent moon, and this can mean you’re growing toward something bigger, fuller, bolder, brighter.
The waxing crescent moon is aligned with the Maiden archetype: the Go-Getter, full of new enthusiasm, mental clarity, and physical vigour, ready to go forth and take on the world.

Think of the moon in its waxing phase: it’s not the new moon anymore, but it’s not the full moon yet either. It’s going somewhere, and that place is bigger and more vibrant — but it’s not there yet.

As a Pink Moon Woman, you may be wrestling with a new stage of self-discovery: Who am I? Who am I becoming? What am I here for and how can I fulfill that purpose?
You may be in a new phase of growing up into adult womanhood, struggling between your idea of what a woman is versus holding onto your younger, freer girl self.

You may feel ready to take bold risks toward the future you desire.

As with all of the menstrual-moon cycles, the connection is not about hard and fast rules but about noticing and inquiring, asking yourself what your cycle pattern could mean for you.
And remember, this can change from month to month as you transition through different phases of your life–none of this is fixed!
If you see that your period is regularly coming after the new moon but before the full moon, start asking yourself:
Are you in a time of transition in your life?
Are you desiring the unconventional path — maybe you’re unsure how to step onto it, or maybe you feel clear and enthusiastic?
Are you leaving girlhood behind, whether literally or metaphorically, and still figuring out what that might mean for you?
Are you feeling a drive to step out into the world and do something daring (like become a social media influencer or social justice warrior), regardless of what anyone says?
