The term ‘white Moon cycle’ describes a menstrual cycle where a woman bleeds with the new Moon and ovulates with the full Moon.

The white Moon cycle is experienced by a lot of women, and historically it’s believed it was far more common than it is today.

So if you get your period around the dark Moon, or new Moon phase, then it means you have a white moon cycle.

If this is you, it means your cycle begins around the new Moon, and energetically, your white Moon cycle and the lunar cycle are closely aligned.

When your menstrual phase occurs during the new Moon (or waning crescent, or dark Moon phases) it can signify a time of new beginnings and fresh starts on multiple levels. It’s auspicious for personal and spiritual rebirth when these natural cycles align.

It makes sense then that the White Moon cycle represents the fertile power of women. Traditionally considered the cycle of the Nurturer or Mother archetype, White Moon women were the ‘good mothers’ birthing and nurturing their babies into being and caring for their homes and families.
Physically, you are bleeding, likely feeling tired and pretty slow and inactive. you may have lower back pain and pelvic cramps.

Your own emotional strength is at its lowest ebb, as is the energy of the Moon at this phase.

Your hormonal levels mean you are likely inwardly focused, preferring quiet time alone to socializing, and low lunar energy mirrors this tendency.

Energetically, this is a time for consciously releasing old, outmoded beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors, along with the bodily release of blood. It’s important to do this now, so that anything that no longer serves us is not carried with us over into the next cycle. The dark and waning crescent Moon phases support this.

Intuition is heightened – the two hemispheres of the brain are most actively communicating at this phase so intuitive insights and messages may be received.
As bleeding slows, it’s time to consciously set intentions for the new cycle, as you emerge from this time of retreat.

For white Moon cycle women, their pre-ovulatory, or follicular phase coincides with the waxing Moon phases.

Physically, the pituitary glands release follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which is the signal the ovaries need to get ready to ovulate.

Physical and emotional energy is rising, and this is mirrored through the waxing Moon.
You likely feel more open to other people and to the possibilities around you.
Rising confidence enables you to attract more of what you desire into your life, and you likely feel more creative, and enthusiastic than you fave in a few weeks. This makes you eager to make plans and put them into action.

For white Moon cycle women, their luteal, or pre-menstrual phase coincides with the waning Moon phases. This marks a decline in physical and emotional energy, and towards the end of the cycle, premenstrual symptoms may appear.
You may become anxious, irritable, and defensive in an attempt to push others away, in order to create the space you need to be alone. This mirrors the waning Moon phases, as lunar energy is also retreating and the darkness grows.
You may feel the desire to perform self-care rituals, to restore and honor the body and aid in its natural cleansing and repair. Emotionally, these kinds of activities (long hot baths, massage, facials, manicures, etc.) help us to feel soothed and grounded.
Emotionally, at both your luteal phase and the waning Moon phase, it’s time to take stock and reflect on the cycle. This can result in either feeling proud of what you’ve achieved or disappointed in what you didn’t.
This reflection is valuable. It prepares you to strip back and release any aspects of yourself no longer desired or required, as you anticipate the release that comes with your next bleeding phase, and the next new Moon.
Spiritually, many people believe that women who menstruate during the new Moon phase are more “in sync” with the natural rhythms of the Earth and the Moon. This is because when the menstrual cycle and the lunar cycle correlate exactly, both cycles can enhance each other.
Spiritually, it’s believed the white Moon cycle emerges through the bodies of women who are in the peak of their own maternal energies. They are fertile, perhaps starting a family, or in the early stages of motherhood.
Women who bleed at the new Moon and ovulate at the full Moon are mirroring the creative, life-giving power of Mother Nature herself.
The full moon is associated with abundance, manifestation, and fertility. Women who ovulate at the full moon tend to embody these qualities – their bodies are ripe, open, and fertile!
They are more available for creative expression, manifestation, and fertility rituals.
Then when the Moon is waning and getting dark, white Moon women are also retreating into their luteal and menstrual phases.
Because white Moon cycle women tend to be the nurturers and caregivers, they can spend a lot of their time and energy supporting others.
By synching menstruation with the lunar cycle, white Moon women are being held by the framework of her rhythms. Spiritually, this offers them the opportunity to rest more deeply at the waning Moon, and gather up the momentum of the waxing Moon phases too.
The full moon cycle represents culmination and completion. It's a time for harvesting the results of your efforts.
If you’re on a White Moon cycle, here are some questions to ask yourself:
Are you desiring children, or do you spend a lot of time mothering?
If you don’t have children of your own, do you take on the role of nurturer in your relationships or your workplace?
Are you growing a creative project or a business that requires a lot of nurturing energy?
