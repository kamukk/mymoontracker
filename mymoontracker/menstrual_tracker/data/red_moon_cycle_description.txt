You are on the Red Moon Cycle.

Menstrual / bleeding phase ⎜FULL MOON
Pre-ovulation / follicular phase⎜WANING MOON
Ovulation phase⎜NEW MOON
Pre-menstrual / luteal phase ⎜WAXING MOON PHASE

The term red Moon cycle woman describes a woman who menstruates with the full Moon. If this is you, it means your cycle begins at the Full Moon.
If you know a little about the Moon cycle, you’ll know that energy rises during the waxing lunar phases, climaxes at the full Moon, then retreats and disseminates during the waning lunar phases.
This cycle is associated with new beginnings and fresh starts. It is a time for setting intentions and planting seeds for future growth.

This cycle is also sometimes referred to as the “Wise Woman” cycle, because in times of old it’s thought it was embodied by the wise women, the medicine women and the healers.This cycle isn’t about fertility in the traditional sense. The body of the red Moon woman isn’t preparing to bear a child.

Knowing this, the energy of the red Moon cycle can feel counterintuitive. It can feel like it goes against the grain of what most of us have been taught about cyclical wisdom, especially growing up in a world that favours women who are beautiful, young, fertile and interested in procreating.
Spiritually, this cycle tends to arise in a woman’s life when she needs to put her power and focus into building, creating and nurturing her own ideas. She has something to birth – some project, wisdom, manifestation of real value – and it must come from deep within.
Women with a red Moon cycle ovulate – reaching the peak of their personal energetic and creative cycle – under the dark Moon. Meaning, as a red cycle woman, you have an abundance of energy available to you, during the dark Moon and New Moon phases.
It’s unique.
And it means the red Moon cycle woman has the opportunity to dive the deepest.
When she is at her most alive, creative and inspired, the world sleeps. Here, she is able to truly meet herself, diving the depths of her inner world, her inner knowing, her unconscious, her soma.
She is the mystic, the dreamer, the priestess of her own domain.
The red Moon cycle is often experienced by women being called into leadership roles. It may be daunting, uncomfortable or unfamiliar to be called onto this path (and modern female leadership isn’t about “power over” or participating in the dominator paradigm. Red Moon cycles are an invitation to begin moving your spiritual energy outward, into the world.
Red Moon cycles are a sign that your spiritual self actualisation needs completion. People need to hear what you have to say.
During red Moon cycles, women bleed during the Full Moon. So instead of this being a bright, dynamic and sociable time, for these red women the peak of the lunar cycle becomes a time of rest and retreat.
When her world is dark, the Full Moon illuminates it for her. This is why women align with red Moon cycles when they are in a process of self-realisation. Women who are discovering, exploring, and becoming their truest, most authentic selves will often experience a full Moon period.
The bleeding is the most spiritually powerful time in a woman’s cycle. When this coincides with the full Moon, the opportunity for spiritual self growth and actualisation are huge!
These are women who can’t hide who they are any longer. They can’t hide behind the roles that our society expects them to play.
When the the red moon woman bleeds, her dark feminine energy is rising into the light of the full Moon.
Her inner world is lit up, and the Goddess is showing the way through her inner realms.
Under the light of the full Moon, the red Moon women can traverse her personal underworld, transmute her shadows, and come back with the gold that the rest of humanity needs.
Women who can call down the potent power of the Full Moon, and combine that with the mysterious, descent of their own bleeding phase were regarded as the witches, healers, shamans, and medicine women of the ancient worlds.
These were the women chosen by the dark feminine. She moves through their lives and out into the world.
Red Moon Cycles are less common that white Moon cycles, maybe because it takes strength, intelligence, awareness and courage to move with this rhythm.
If you’re on a Red Moon Cycle, you might want to ask yourself:
Do you desire self-exploration and self-expression?
Has your role of mothering children finished?
Is child-rearing a role you’re postponing for the future or not planning on at all?
Do you feel called to be a healer or wisdom-sharer, to dive deep into your depths to develop your self-awareness and then turn that energy outward to help the world?
